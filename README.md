Save Scripty (Doctor Worm Enhanced) - Oliver Ruprich

Story: Scripty has cancer- OH NO!!!!! Codey signed his brother (Scripty) up for a doctor's appointment. What he doesn't know is that Dr. Worm's Healing Hospitality is cursed! Dr. Worm sent Scripty to his hospital room where he will be poisoned with a dose of anti-anti-cancer. His brother (Codey) has to save him by solving puzzles. Whether they'res lasers, crates, teleporters, Codey will save his brother in Save Scripty.

Level 1: Level 1 is simple, all that happens is that there is a door Codey needs to open by pressing a button. Once he does it, he'll need to run quick to the door and teleport to the next room.

Level 2: Codey has to move a couple crates in between lasers. At the end of the level, there are two buttons that needs a box and Codey to step on it. Once the two buttons are activated, the door will open and he will be teleported to the next room.

Level 3: There are 6 turrets and a room where Codey gets teleported. He has to step off the button he is pressing to close the door in order to be safe from the lasers. Then he has to deactivate it by stepping on a pressure plate that shuts off the power which also stops the turret from pointing at Codey and shooting lasers.

Level 4: This level combines all elements of previous levels (except for turrets because the turrets are kinda bad-) as the player has to push the box into the laser so the player can get past successfully and push the button that opens the door. The door leads to a room where the player must push another box into the laser to teleport to the other room.

Level 5: This level introduces a new mechanic- BEHOLD!- TELEPORT PAD!!! The teleport pad allows players to teleport to another teleport pad on the map. In this level, the player has to push a box into the laser to get to the teleporter pad because the teleporter that teleports you to other rooms is on the other side of the wall. Anyway, once the player gets teleported, he will go to the other side of the wall and will have to push the box onto the button that opens the door. Once Codey enters the room, he'll teleport to another room.

Level 6: This level basically introduces mechanics from all levels. First player teleports through wall, in that room grabs key, and then grabs the rocket launcher by moving lasers, and yeah. you get the point
